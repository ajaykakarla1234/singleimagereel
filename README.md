This Jupyter Notebook (singleimagereel.ipynb) is a Python script for automating the creation of short motivational quote videos. It uses APIs (Groq for text generation, Hugging Face for image generation, and Google YouTube for uploading) to:

Generate a motivational quote and matching visual description.
Create an image based on the description.
Overlay text on the image.
Compile it into a video with background music.
Optionally upload the video to YouTube.
The notebook includes multiple cells with iterations of the code, installation commands, and YouTube upload setup. It's designed for content creation workflows but requires API setup and careful handling of credentials.
